===========================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

  ``envoy.reloadable_features.wait_for_first_byte_before_balsa_msg_done`` to false.
* **happy_eyeballs**: Validate that ``additional_address`` are IP addresses instead of crashing when sorting.
* **http/1**: Fixes sending overload crashes when HTTP/1 request is reset.
