Kafka Broker (proto)
====================

.. _extension_envoy.filters.network.kafka_broker:

This extension has the qualified name ``envoy.filters.network.kafka_broker``

.. note::

  This extension is only available in :ref:`contrib <install_contrib>` images.

.. note::
  This extension is work-in-progress. Functionality is incomplete and it is not intended for production use.

  This extension is not hardened and should only be used in deployments
  where both the downstream and upstream are trusted.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.filters.network <extension_category_envoy.filters.network>`





Kafka Broker :ref:`configuration overview <config_network_filters_kafka_broker>`.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.KafkaBroker.stat_prefix:


stat_prefix
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The prefix to use when emitting :ref:`statistics <config_network_filters_kafka_broker_stats>`.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.KafkaBroker.force_response_rewrite:


force_response_rewrite
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Set to true if broker filter should attempt to serialize the received responses from the
  upstream broker instead of passing received bytes as is.
  Disabled by default.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.KafkaBroker.id_based_broker_address_rewrite_spec:


id_based_broker_address_rewrite_spec
  (:ref:`extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.IdBasedBrokerRewriteSpec <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.IdBasedBrokerRewriteSpec>`) Broker address rewrite rules that match by broker ID.


  Optional broker address rewrite specification.
  Allows the broker filter to rewrite Kafka responses so that all connections established by
  the Kafka clients point to Envoy.
  This allows Kafka cluster not to configure its 'advertised.listeners' property
  (as the necessary re-pointing will be done by this filter).
  This collection of rules should cover all brokers in the cluster that is being proxied,
  otherwise some nodes' addresses might leak to the downstream clients.

:repo:`[extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.IdBasedBrokerRewriteRule proto] <api/contrib/envoy/extensions/filters/network/kafka_broker/v3/kafka_broker.proto#L49>`

Defines a rule to rewrite broker address data.

    "id": ...,
    "host": ...,
    "port": ...
  }

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.IdBasedBrokerRewriteRule.id:


id
  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Broker ID to match.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.IdBasedBrokerRewriteRule.host:


host
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The host value to use (resembling the host part of Kafka's advertised.listeners).
  The value should point to the Envoy (not Kafka) listener, so that all client traffic goes
  through Envoy.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.kafka_broker.v3.IdBasedBrokerRewriteRule.port:


port
  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The port value to use (resembling the port part of Kafka's advertised.listeners).
  The value should point to the Envoy (not Kafka) listener, so that all client traffic goes
  through Envoy.
