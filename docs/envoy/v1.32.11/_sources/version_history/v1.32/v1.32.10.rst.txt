1.32.10 (August 19, 2025)
==========================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **http**: Fixed a bug where the premature resets of streams may result in the recursive draining and potential
  stack overflow. Setting proper ``max_concurrent_streams`` value for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 could eliminate
  the risk of the stack overflow before this fix.
* **listeners**: Fixed issue where :ref:`TLS inspector listener filter <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` timed out
  when used with other listener filters. The bug was triggered when a previous listener filter processed more data
  than the TLS inspector had requested, causing the TLS inspector to incorrectly calculate its buffer growth strategy.
  The fix ensures that buffer growth is now based on actual bytes available rather than the previously requested amount.




New features
------------


* **http**: Added :ref:`ignore_http_11_upgrade
  <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http1ProtocolOptions.ignore_http_11_upgrade>`
  to ignore HTTP/1.1 Upgrade values matching any of the supplied matchers.
