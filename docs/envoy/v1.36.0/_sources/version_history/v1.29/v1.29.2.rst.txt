1.29.2 (March 7, 2024)
=======================




Incompatible behavior changes
-----------------------------

*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*



* **http2**: Changes the default value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to ``false``. This changes the codec used for HTTP/2
  requests and responses. A number of users have reported issues with oghttp2 including issue 32611 and issue 32401 This behavior
  can be reverted by setting the feature to ``true``.




Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **jwt_authn**: Fixed JWT extractor, which concatenated headers with a comma, resultig in invalid tokens.




New features
------------


* **google_grpc**: Added an off-by-default runtime flag
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.google_grpc_disable_tls_13`` to disable TLSv1.3
  usage by gRPC SDK for ``google_grpc`` services.
