1.27.6 (June 4, 2024)
======================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **async http client**: Added one option to disable the response body buffering for mirror request. Also introduced a 32MB cap for the response
  buffer, which can be changed by the runtime flag ``http.async_response_buffer_limit`` based on the product needs.
* **decompression**: Fixed a bug where Envoy will go into an endless loop when using the brotli decompressor. If the input stream has
  redundant data, the decompressor will loop forever.
* **quic**: Applied 2 QUICHE patches for crash bugs in ``QuicSpdyStream`` ``OnDataAvailable()`` and ``OnInitialHeaderComplete()``.
* **quic**: Fixed crash bug when QUIC downstream stream was read closed and then timed out.
* **router**: Fix a timing issue when upstream requests are empty when decoding data and send local reply when that happends. This is
  controlled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_send_local_reply_when_no_buffer_and_upstream_request``.
* **websocket**: Only 101 is considered a successful response for websocket handshake for HTTP/1.1, and Envoy as a proxy will proxy the response
  header from upstream to downstream and then close the request if other status is received. This behavior can be
  reverted by ``envoy_reloadable_features_check_switch_protocol_websocket_handshake``.
