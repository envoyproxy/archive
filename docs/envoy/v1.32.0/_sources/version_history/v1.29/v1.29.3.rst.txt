=======================




Incompatible behavior changes
-----------------------------

*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*



* **http**: Remove the hop by hop TE header from downstream request headers if it's not set to ``trailers``, else keep it. This change can be
  temporarily reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_te`` to false.



Minor behavior changes
----------------------

*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*



* **http2**: Simplifies integration with the codec by removing translation between nghttp2 callbacks and Http2VisitorInterface events.
  Guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_skip_callback_visitor``.



Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **http2**: Update nghttp2 to resolve (CVE-2024-30255 https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j654-3ccm-vfmm).
