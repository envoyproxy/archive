1.26.7 (February 9, 2024)
==========================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **buffer**: Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
  behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
* **http**: Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
* **http**: Fixed recursion when HTTP connection is disconnected due to a high number of premature resets.
* **proxy protocol**: fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
  a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
* **proxy_protocol**: Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
  received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
* **proxy_protocol**: Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
  ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
* **url matching**: Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
