  to fire.
* **access_log**: Relaxed the restriction on SNI logging to allow the ``_`` character, even if
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_sni_in_access_log`` is enabled.
* **original_ip_detection**: Reverted :ref:`custom header
  <v1.32:envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.original_ip_detection.custom_header.v3.CustomHeaderConfig>` extension to its
  original behavior by disabling automatic XFF header appending that was inadvertently introduced in PR #31831.
