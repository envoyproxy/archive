===========================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **dns**: Fixed an UAF in DNS cache that can occur when the Host header is modified between the Dynamic Forwarding and Router
  filters.
* **oauth2**: Fixed an issue where cookies prefixed with ``__Secure-`` or ``__Host-`` were not receiving a
  Secure attribute.
* **stats**: Fixed a bug where the metric name ``expiration_unix_time_seconds`` of
  ``cluster.<cluster_name>.ssl.certificate.<cert_name>.<metric_name>``
  and ``listener.<address>.ssl.certificate.<cert_name>.<metric_name>``
  was not being properly extracted in the final prometheus stat name.
