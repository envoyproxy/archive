Dynamic Modules common configuration (proto)
============================================






.. _envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig:

extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig
-------------------------------------------------


:repo:`[extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig proto] <api/envoy/extensions/dynamic_modules/v3/dynamic_modules.proto#L31>`

Configuration of a dynamic module. A dynamic module is a shared object file that can be loaded via dlopen
by various Envoy extension points. Currently, only HTTP filter (envoy.filters.http.dynamic_modules) is supported.

How a module is loaded is determined by the extension point that uses it. For example, the HTTP filter
loads the module with dlopen when Envoy receives a configuration that references the module at load time.
If loading the module fails, the configuration will be rejected.

Whether or not the shared object is the same is determined by the file path as well as the file's inode depending
on the platform. Notably, if the file path and the content of the file are the same, the shared object will be reused.

A module must be compatible with the ABI specified in :repo:`abi.h <source/extensions/dynamic_modules/abi.h>`.
Currently, compatibility is only guaranteed by an exact version match between the Envoy
codebase and the dynamic module SDKs. In the future, after the ABI is stabilized, we will revisit
this restriction and hopefully provide a wider compatibility guarantee. Until then, Envoy
checks the hash of the ABI header files to ensure that the dynamic modules are built against the
same version of the ABI.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig.name:


name
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The name of the dynamic module. The client is expected to have some configuration indicating where to search for the module.
  In Envoy, the search path can only be configured via the environment variable ``ENVOY_DYNAMIC_MODULES_SEARCH_PATH``.
  The actual search path is ``${ENVOY_DYNAMIC_MODULES_SEARCH_PATH}/lib${name}.so``. TODO: make the search path configurable via
  command line options.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig.do_not_close:


do_not_close
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Set true to prevent the module from being unloaded with dlclose.
  This is useful for modules that have global state that should not be unloaded.
  A module is closed when no more references to it exist in the process. For example,
  no HTTP filters are using the module (e.g. after configuration update).
