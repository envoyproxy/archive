1.34.2 (July 9, 2025)
======================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **config_validation**: Fixed an bug where the config validation server will crash when the configuration contains
  ``%CEL%`` or ``%METADATA%`` substitution formatter.
* **conn_pool**: Fixed an issue that could lead to insufficient connections for current pending requests. If a connection starts draining while it
  has negative unused capacity (which happens if an HTTP/2 ``SETTINGS`` frame reduces allowed concurrency to below the current number
  of requests), that connection's unused capacity will be included in total pool capacity even though it is unusable because it is
  draining. This can result in not enough connections being established for current pending requests. This is most problematic for
  long-lived requests (such as streaming gRPC requests or long-poll requests) because a connection could be in the draining state
  for a long time.
* **conn_pool**: Fixed an issue that could lead to too many connections when using
  :ref:`AutoHttpConfig <v1.34:envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.AutoHttpConfig>` if the
  established connection is ``http/2`` and Envoy predicted it would have lower concurrent capacity.
* **http3**: Validate HTTP/3 pseudo headers. Can be disabled by setting ``envoy.restart_features.validate_http3_pseudo_headers`` to false.
* **release**: Container (Ubuntu) updates to resolve glibc vulnerabilities.
