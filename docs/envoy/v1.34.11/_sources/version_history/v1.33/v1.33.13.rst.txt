1.33.13 (December 3, 2025)
===========================




Incompatible behavior changes
-----------------------------

*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*



* **http**: Added runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data`` to reject ``CONNECT`` requests
  that receive data before Envoy sent a ``200`` response to the client. While this is not a strictly compliant behavior
  it is very common as a latency reducing measure. As such the option is disabled by default.




Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **http**: Fixed a remote ``jwt_auth`` token fetch crash with two or more auth headers when ``allow_missing_or_failed`` is set.
* **tls**: Fixed an issue where SANs of type ``OTHERNAME`` in a TLS cert were truncated if there was
  an embedded null octet, leading to incorrect SAN validation.
