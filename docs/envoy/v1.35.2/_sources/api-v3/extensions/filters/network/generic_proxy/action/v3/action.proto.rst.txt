Configuration for the route match action.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.action.v3.RouteAction.name:


name
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The name of the route action. This should be unique across all route actions.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.action.v3.RouteAction.cluster:


cluster
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) Indicates the upstream cluster to which the request should be routed.


  

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.action.v3.RouteAction.metadata:


metadata
  (:ref:`config.core.v3.Metadata <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.Metadata>`) Route metadata.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.action.v3.RouteAction.per_filter_config:


per_filter_config
  (**repeated** map<`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, `Any <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#any>`_>) Route level config for L7 generic filters. The key should be the related :ref:`extension name
  <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.TypedExtensionConfig.name>` in the :ref:`generic filters
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy.filters>`.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.action.v3.RouteAction.timeout:


timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Specifies the upstream timeout for the route. If not specified, the default is 15s. This
  spans between the point at which the entire downstream request (i.e. end-of-stream) has been
  processed and when the upstream response has been completely processed. A value of 0 will
  disable the route's timeout.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.action.v3.RouteAction.retry_policy:


retry_policy
  (:ref:`config.core.v3.RetryPolicy <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.RetryPolicy>`) Specifies the retry policy for the route. If not specified, then no retries will be performed.

  .. note::
    Only simplest retry policy is supported and only ``num_retries`` field is used for generic
    proxy. The default value for ``num_retries`` is 1 means that the request will be tried once
    and no additional retries will be performed.
