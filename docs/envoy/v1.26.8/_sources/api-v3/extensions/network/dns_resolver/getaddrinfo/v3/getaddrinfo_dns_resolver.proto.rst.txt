getaddrinfo DNS resolver (proto)
================================

.. _extension_envoy.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo:

This extension has the qualified name ``envoy.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo``


.. note::
  

  This extension is intended to be robust against both untrusted downstream and
  upstream traffic.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.network.dns_resolver <extension_category_envoy.network.dns_resolver>`



  This extension must be configured with one of the following type URLs:



  - :ref:`type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig>`







.. _envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig:

extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


:repo:`[extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig proto] <api/envoy/extensions/network/dns_resolver/getaddrinfo/v3/getaddrinfo_dns_resolver.proto#L28>`

Configuration for getaddrinfo DNS resolver. This resolver will use the system's getaddrinfo()
function to resolve hosts.

.. attention::

  This resolver uses a single background thread to do resolutions. As such, it is not currently
  advised for use in situations requiring a high resolution rate. A thread pool can be added
  in the future if needed.

.. attention::

  Resolutions currently use a hard coded TTL of 60s because the getaddrinfo() API does not
  provide the actual TTL. Configuration for this can be added in the future if needed.
