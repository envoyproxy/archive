1.24.6 (April 12, 2023)
========================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **dependency**: update Curl -> 8.0.1 to resolve CVE-2023-27535, CVE-2023-27536, CVE-2023-27538.
* **http**: amend the fix for ``x-envoy-original-path`` so it removes the header only at edge.
  Previously this would also remove the header at any Envoy instance upstream of an external request, including an Envoy
  instance that added the header.
