Downstream connections (proto)
==============================

.. _extension_envoy.resource_monitors.downstream_connections:

This extension has the qualified name ``envoy.resource_monitors.downstream_connections``


.. note::
  This extension is work-in-progress. Functionality is incomplete and it is not intended for production use.

  This extension does not operate on the data plane and hence is intended to be robust against untrusted traffic.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.resource_monitors <extension_category_envoy.resource_monitors>`



  This extension must be configured with one of the following type URLs:



  - :ref:`type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>`



.. warning::
   This API feature is currently work-in-progress. API features marked as work-in-progress are not considered stable, are not covered by the :ref:`threat model <arch_overview_threat_model>`, are not supported by the security team, and are subject to breaking changes. Do not use this feature without understanding each of the previous points.

max_active_downstream_connections
  (`int64 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Maximum threshold for global open downstream connections, defaults to 0.
  If monitor is enabled in Overload manager api, this field should be explicitly configured with value greater than 0.
