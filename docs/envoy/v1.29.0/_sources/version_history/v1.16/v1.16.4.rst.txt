======================








New features
------------


* **http**: added the ability to :ref:`unescape slash sequences
  <v1.16:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action>`
  in the path. Requests with unescaped slashes can be proxied, rejected or redirected to the new unescaped path. By
  default this feature is disabled. The default behavior can be overridden through
  :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action<v1.16:config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action>`
  runtime variable. This action can be selectively enabled for a portion of requests by setting the
  :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action_sampling<v1.16:config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action_enabled>`
  runtime variable.
