default_language
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The default language to be used as a fallback.
  The value will be included in the list of the supported languages.

supported_languages
  (**repeated** `string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The set of supported languages. There is no order priority.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.language.v3alpha.Language.clear_route_cache:


clear_route_cache
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If the x-language header is altered, clear the route cache for the current request.
  This should be set if the route configuration may depend on the x-language header.
  Otherwise it should be unset to avoid the performance cost of route recalculation.
