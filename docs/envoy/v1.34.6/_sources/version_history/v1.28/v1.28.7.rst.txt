1.28.7 (September 19, 2024)
============================




Incompatible behavior changes
-----------------------------

*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*



* **http**: The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in the future it will not trust them by default.
  If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary ``x-envoy``
  headers) please explictily include those addresses or CIDR ranges into :ref:`internal_address_config
  <v1.28:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config>`
  See the config examples from the above ``internal_address_config`` link. This default no trust internal address can be turned on by
  setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`` to ``true``.



Minor behavior changes
----------------------

*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*



* **access_log**: Sanitize SNI for potential log injection. The invalid character will be replaced by ``_`` with an ``invalid:`` marker. If runtime
  flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_sni_in_access_log`` is set to ``false``, the sanitize behavior is disabled.



Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **http_async_client**: Fixed the local reply and destroy order crashes when using the http async client for websocket handshake.
