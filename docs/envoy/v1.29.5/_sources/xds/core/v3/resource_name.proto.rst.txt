.. _envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.core.v3.ResourceName:

.xds.core.v3.ResourceName
-------------------------


`[.xds.core.v3.ResourceName proto] <https://github.com/cncf/xds/blob/main/xds/core/v3/resource_name.proto#L25>`_

xDS resource name. This has a canonical xdstp:// URI representation:

  xdstp://{authority}/{type_url}/{id}?{context_params}

where context_params take the form of URI query parameters.

A xDS resource name fully identifies a network resource for transport
purposes. xDS resource names in this form appear only in discovery
request/response messages used with the xDS transport.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.core.v3.ResourceName.id:


id
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Opaque identifier for the resource. Any '/' will not be escaped during URI
  encoding and will form part of the URI path.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.core.v3.ResourceName.authority:


authority
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Logical authority for resource (not necessarily transport network address).
  Authorities are opaque in the xDS API, data-plane load balancers will map
  them to concrete network transports such as an xDS management server.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.core.v3.ResourceName.resource_type:


resource_type
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) Fully qualified resource type (as in type URL without types.googleapis.com/
  prefix).


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.core.v3.ResourceName.context:


context
  (:ref:`.xds.core.v3.ContextParams <envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.core.v3.ContextParams>`) Additional parameters that can be used to select resource variants.
