1.32.4 (March 20, 2025)
========================





Minor behavior changes
----------------------

*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*



* **rds**: When a new RDS provider config is pushed via xDS and the only difference is change to
  :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>`,
  the already existing provider will be reused. Envoy will not ask RDS server for routes
  config because existing provider already has up to date routes config.
  This behavioral change can be enabled by setting runtime guard
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.normalize_rds_provider_config`` to true.



Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **ext_proc**: Fixes a bug where local replies were incorrectly sent to the ext_proc server for external processing.
  This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_skip_ext_proc_on_local_reply``
  to ``false``.
* **lrs**: Fixes errors stat being incremented and warning log spamming for LoadStatsReporting graceful stream close.
* **router**: Fixes an Envoy crash issue when a local reply is sent.
  This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
  ``envoy_reloadable_features_router_filter_resetall_on_local_reply`` to ``false``.
