This extension has the qualified name ``envoy.upstream.local_address_selector.default_local_address_selector``


.. note::

  used in deployments where both the downstream and upstream are
  trusted.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.upstream.local_address_selector <extension_category_envoy.upstream.local_address_selector>`



  This extension must be configured with one of the following type URLs:



  - :ref:`type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.upstream.local_address_selector.v3.DefaultLocalAddressSelector <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.upstream.local_address_selector.v3.DefaultLocalAddressSelector>`

:repo:`[config.upstream.local_address_selector.v3.DefaultLocalAddressSelector proto] <api/envoy/config/upstream/local_address_selector/v3/default_local_address_selector.proto#L29>`

Default implementation of a local address selector. This implementation is
used if :ref:`local_address_selector
<envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.local_address_selector>` is not
specified.
This implementation supports the specification of only one address in
:ref:`extra_source_addresses
<envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.extra_source_addresses>` which
is appended to the address specified in the
:ref:`source_address <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.source_address>`
field. The extra address should have a different IP version than the address in the
``source_address`` field. The address which has the same IP
version with the target host's address IP version will be used as bind address.
If there is no same IP version address found, the address in the ``source_address`` field will
be returned.
