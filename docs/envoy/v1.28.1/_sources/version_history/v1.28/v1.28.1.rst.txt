1.28.1 (February 9, 2024)
==========================




Incompatible behavior changes
-----------------------------

*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*



* **listener**: undeprecated runtime key ``overload.global_downstream_max_connections`` until :ref:`downstream connections monitor
  <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` extension becomes stable.




Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **buffer**: Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
  behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
* **grpc**: Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
* **http**: Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
* **proxy protocol**: Fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
  a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
* **proxy_protocol**: Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
  received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
* **proxy_protocol**: Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
  ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
* **quic**: Fixed a bug in QUIC and HCM interaction which could cause use-after-free during asynchronous certificates retrieval.
  The fix is guarded by runtime ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_fix_filter_manager_uaf``.
* **tls**: Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
  received in an mTLS client cert IP SAN. These SANs will be ignored. This applies only when using formatter
  ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_IP_SAN%``.
* **tracing**: Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
  should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
* **tracing**: Fixed a bug where Datadog spans tagged as errors would not have the appropriate error property set.
* **tracing**: Fixed a bug where child spans produced by the Datadog tracer would have an incorrect operation name.
* **url matching**: Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
