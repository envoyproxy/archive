  when TLS protocol is detected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------


:repo:`[extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.ApplicationProtocolInput proto] <api/envoy/extensions/matching/common_inputs/network/v3/network_inputs.proto#L96>`

List of quoted and comma-separated requested application protocols. The list consists of a
single negotiated application protocol once the network stream is established.

Examples:

* ``'h2','http/1.1'``
* ``'h2c'``

Suggested values in the list include:

* ``http/1.1`` - set by :ref:`envoy.filters.listener.tls_inspector
  <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` and :ref:`envoy.filters.listener.http_inspector
  <config_listener_filters_http_inspector>`,
* ``h2`` - set by :ref:`envoy.filters.listener.tls_inspector <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>`
* ``h2c`` - set by :ref:`envoy.filters.listener.http_inspector <config_listener_filters_http_inspector>`

.. attention::

  Currently, :ref:`TLS Inspector <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` provides
  application protocol detection based on the requested
  `ALPN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation>`_ values.

  However, the use of ALPN is pretty much limited to the HTTP/2 traffic on the Internet,
  and matching on values other than ``h2`` is going to lead to a lot of false negatives,
  unless all connecting clients are known to use ALPN.
