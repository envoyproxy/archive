include_unroutable_families
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The resolver will avoid the system's heuristics to only return
  IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that it considers to be "routable", instead
  returning all possible IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. This setting is
  ignored if the DNS lookup family is set to v4-only or v6-only.
  This should remain false in the vast majority of cases, but may be
  useful when performing custom filtering of addresses, such as with
  Happy Eyeballs.
