1.32.8 (July 18, 2025)
=======================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **dynatrace**: Fixed a division by zero bug in the Dynatrace sampling controller that occurred when ``total_wanted`` was less than
  ``top_k_size``. The calculation was refactored to avoid the intermediate division that could result in zero.
* **release**: Container (Ubuntu/distroless) updates, and fixed permissions for distroless config directory.
