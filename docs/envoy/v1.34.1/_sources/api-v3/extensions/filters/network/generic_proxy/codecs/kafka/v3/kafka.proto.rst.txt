.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.generic_proxy.codecs <extension_category_envoy.generic_proxy.codecs>`



  This extension must be configured with one of the following type URLs:



  - :ref:`type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.codecs.kafka.v3.KafkaCodecConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.codecs.kafka.v3.KafkaCodecConfig>`



.. warning::
   This API feature is currently work-in-progress. API features marked as work-in-progress are not considered stable, are not covered by the :ref:`threat model <arch_overview_threat_model>`, are not supported by the security team, and are subject to breaking changes.

Configuration for Kafka codec. This codec gives the generic proxy the ability to proxy
Kafka traffic. But note any route configuration for Kafka traffic is not supported yet.
The generic proxy can only used to generate logs or metrics for Kafka traffic but cannot
do matching or routing.

.. note::
  The codec can currently only be used in the sidecar mode. And to ensure the codec works
  properly, please make sure the following conditions are met:

  1. The generic proxy must be configured with a wildcard route that matches all traffic.
  2. The target cluster must be configured as a original destination cluster.
  3. The :ref:`bind_upstream_connection
     <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.router.v3.Router.bind_upstream_connection>`
     of generic proxy router must be set to true to ensure same upstream connection is used
     for all traffic from same downstream connection.
