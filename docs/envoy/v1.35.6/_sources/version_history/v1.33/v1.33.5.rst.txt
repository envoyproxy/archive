1.33.5 (July 18, 2025)
=======================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **dynatrace**: Fixed a division by zero bug in the Dynatrace sampling controller that occurred when ``total_wanted`` was less than
  ``top_k_size``. The calculation was refactored to avoid the intermediate division that could result in zero.
* **release**: Container (Ubuntu/distroless) updates, and fixed permissions for distroless config directory.
* **tls**: Fixed an issue with incorrectly cached connection properties on TLS connections.
  If TLS connection data was queried before it was available, an empty value was being incorrectly cached, preventing later calls from
  getting the correct value. This could be triggered with a ``tcp_proxy`` access log configured to emit a log upon connection
  establishment if the log contains fields of the the TLS peer certificate. Then a later use of the data, such as the network RBAC
  filter validating a peer certificate SAN, may incorrectly fail due to the empty cached value.
